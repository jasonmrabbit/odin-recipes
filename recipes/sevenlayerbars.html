    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        <em>A buttery graham cracker crust is topped with layers of chocolate
            chips, butterscotch chips, coconut, chopped nuts, and then
            finished off with a blanket of sweetened condensed milk. These
            will not last long!</em>

        Seven layer bars are an easy, sweet dessert bar made up of seven ingredients.
        The preparation of these bars is super simple; make the crust, place
        the crust in the bottom of the pan, then layer the remaining ingredients
        on top and bake.
