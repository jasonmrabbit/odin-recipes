    <h3>Recipes for food seen at a classic Midwestern Get-Together!</h3>
    <p>Round up the troops, there's food to be devoured! Everyone bring a large dish of some home-cooked chow and we'll be good to go! Don't forget to grab a pop or beer out of one of the 5 coolers on your way back with your overflowing plate. And yes, the desert table is the same size as the main food table. Hoepfully you didn't already fill up on the nut and candy bowls sitting out on the tables.</p>
